How I installed GLFW Binaries for Windows:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12886609/setting-up-glfw-with-mingw
Had to put GLFW/glfw3.h into C:\MinGW64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include
Had to put *.a static libraries into C:\MinGW64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib
Put the glfw3.dll in System32 folder

Since we are using the GLFW dll and linking statically, at the top of main.cpp you must specify the macro
        #define GLFW_DLL



Had to install GLEW to get support for openGL verions higher than 1.1
http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html

To do so you need to build it yourself for use with MinGW64. They only have prebuilt binaries
available for use with Visual Studios and Visual C++. Here are some instructions I followed:
https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/198730-How-do-I-build-GLEW-for-mingw-w64-using-cmake-on-Windows?p=1283379&viewfull=1#post1283379
But I have included the built binaries for MinGW64 in the GLTools/glew-2.1.0.lib folder
Follow a similar pattern as with GLFW for install of GLEW:
    1. Place the include/GL folder in the C:\MinGW64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include
    2. Place teh *.a static libraries into C:\MinGW64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib
    3. Place the glew32.dll in System32 folder

Since we are using the GLEW dll and linking statically, at the top of main.cpp you must specify the macro
        #define GLEW_STATIC

Header and Source for OBJ/Shader file loading gotten from:
https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/master/common


To Be Implemented:

Add Tagging System with ability to get Entities By Tagging
**Maybe also add specific Name System to entities too?
**Decouple the entity stuff from the world into it's own class?

Add Object Heirarchies (specifically for transforms)
Move/Decouple Input from world (as singleton static class?)
Decouple Camera entirely from Render System
**Make it a component that can be added to any entity
**Needs info on FOV, Transform (will this be from entity? Heirarchy?)
**Also need a way to know the screen resolution I believe 


Improve extendability of RenderSystem
**Support Texture Loading
**Support arbitrary vertexShader Input Attributes
**Support Indexed Rendering
**Support Batch/Instanced Rendering? Scene Graph?

Add Lighting component
Add Particle System

Add Collision Detection
**Collider Component for Primitives (Sphere/Box/Capsule(?))
**Collision System will test all entities with Collider Component
  against each other, adding those that collide to proper list in
  colliderComponent (Enter/Stay/Exit)

Add Basic Physics System
**Will need a rigidbody component
**Gravity/IsKinematic (no Physics)

Add Physics Utility to do raycasts from Systems
**Will need to have access to all entities with Collider Component
**Should this be static member function of Physics System??


Example WorldConfig.txt (subject to change):
    ENTITY
    PHYSICS 0 0 0 0
    RENDER modelFile.obj vertShader.vert fragShader.frag
    /ENTITY

Basic Documentation of Classes:

ComponentManager:
    std::vector<std::unordered_map<int, int>>                       // maps entityID to index in component vector
    std::vector<std::vector<ComponentBase>> componentList           // list containing the actual components themselves

Entity:
    int entityID                                        // Unique ID of this entity
    componenetSignature ownedComponents                 // Bitset of all components this entity has

System:
    componentSignature neededComponents                 // Biset of components an entity needs to be part of system
    std::vector<int> entities                           // A list of all entities part of this system

World:
    int currID                                          // Next ID to be assigned to entity
    std::vector<System> worldSystems                    // Systems that will be updated (needs to be ordered)
